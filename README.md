## In order for this program to work you must install a MYSQL/Apache instance, we used MAMP(my port was 3008) that 
way you can import into PHPMYADMIN our c_projet.sql and have a MYSQL connection for our database. You must have 
codeblocks installed,  the MYSQL folder in this folder you will 
place in the codeblocks' MINGW include folder and libmysql.a you will place in 
codeblocks->MINGW->MINGW32->lib. We have fmod api already in our folder, So no need to do anything.
You will place our GTK3+ file in program files (x86). Enjoy!
